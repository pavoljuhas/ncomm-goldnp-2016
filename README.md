This folder contain X-ray total scattering data described in the paper:

Polymorphism in magic sized Au144(SR)60 clusters
Kirsten M. Ø. Jensen, Pavol Juhas, Marcus A. Tofanelli, Christine L. Heinecke,  Gavin Vaughan, Christopher J. Ackerson, and Simon J. L. Billinge


for publication in Nature Communications, 2016. The samples, data acquisition and data reduction processes are described in detail therein.

The following data files are given:

Au144PET_100K_APS.chi
Au144PET_100K_APS.gr
Au144SC4_100K_APS.chi
Au144SC4_100K_APS.gr
Au144SC6_100K_APS.chi
Au144SC6_100K_APS.gr
Au144SC12_100K_APS.chi
Au144SC12_100K_APS.gr
Kapton_APS.chi
Au144pMBA_100K_ESRF.chi
Au144pMBA_100K_ESRF.gr

Datasets from 5 different samples are deposited:  Au144(PET)60, Au144(SC4)60, Au144(SC6)60, Au144(SC12)60 and Au144(pMBA)60, as stated in the file names. All scattering data are measured at 100K.
The first 4 datasets were obtained at 11-ID-B, APS, with a wavelength of 0.143 Å. The data are given as integrated total scattering data in Q (nm^-1) (.chi-files) and as reduced PDFs, i.e. .gr-files. The file names "Kapton_100K_APS.chi" is the background file to be used with the APS data.
The last dataset, Au144pMBA_100K were obtained at ID11 at the ESRF with a wavelength of 0.177Å. Here, the background has already been subtracted.
